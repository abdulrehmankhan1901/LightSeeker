# LightSeeker
A 3D Game made in Unreal Engine using C++ and Blueprints. I have added comments throughout the code to aid anyone who wants to read the code. There can be more improvements, but this should serve as good base for other projects. This should serve as a great project for people to start learning Unreal Engine C++. Feel free to contact me on my email.
